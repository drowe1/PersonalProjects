These are projects I have done on my own time outside of the classroom.
Most of the projects are not very user friendly as they were made for personal use.

The Compound project allows users to see how much money they will have saved for retirement by calculating compound interest.
The Robot tester was made for me to convince my friend TJ that he is a robot.
The Taxes project was made so that the user could see how much of their income is getting taxed and how much is taken home.
The Finance project is my most complete project and combines the Compound project and the Taxes project. It is also the most user friendly.
